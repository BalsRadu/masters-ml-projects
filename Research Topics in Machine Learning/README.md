The enviroment can take quite a while to set up. I recomand to comment out ollama and open-webui in environment.yaml and install the rest of the packages first. Then install ollama and open-webui separately with pip. Open-webui is not necessary for the project, but it is a nice tool UI to test the models capabilities.
